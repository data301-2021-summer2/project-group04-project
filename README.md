{As we are both big fans of movies it was really a matter of time when we came up with the idea of trying to process the data of films around the world. As there are a lot of websites and providers of films, we have decided to go with the biggest and most well-known provider of films and movies, Netflix. As we are both from information technology sphere (Data Science Major and Computer Science Major), we would like to know more about how, which, and what makes a film such a big hit and which exactly are the best genres are preferred all over the world? Which films have had the highest revenue and which ones have spent the most out of their budget to create such films? Which genres that are preferred based on the nationality and geolocation? How many films does Netflix provide each year and their budget for each film? What is their exact revenue for each film? These are some of the questions we wanted to know the answer to.}
