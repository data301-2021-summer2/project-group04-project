## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

As we are both big fans of movies it was really a matter of time when we came up with the idea of trying to process the data of films around the world. As there are a lot of websites and providers of films, we have decided to go with the biggest and most well-known provider of films and movies, Netflix. As we are both from information technology sphere (Data Science Major and Computer Science Major), we would like to know more about how, which, and what makes a film such a big hit and which exactly are the best genres are preferred all over the world? Which films have had the highest revenue and which ones have spent the most out of their budget to create such films? Which genres that are preferred based on the nationality and geolocation? How many films does Netflix provide each year and their budget for each film? What is their exact revenue for each film? These are some of the questions we wanted to know the answer to.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset for Netflix shows and films has close to 8000 total number of movies and all of them have unique properties and descriptions. We believe that the dataset that we have chosen is unique from others due to the fact that it is the biggest dataset available about Netflix while also including films from all over the world (international movies). Despite being being immensly large which is close to 8000 unique values (films and TV shows), our data specifies not only the length/duration, the date and the country of production, but also rating, the director and the cast and crew members of each and every film. While being the largest dataset about Netflix, it only has ~3.9% null values and to us it not only sounds impressive but one of a kind. The null values of our dataset is centralized around director column which is accounted for 31% of that column.
